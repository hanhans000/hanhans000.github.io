            <br>
            <p> The first thing that stands out to me is the clean, minimalist design. This design choice is not only aesthetic but also functional. It creates a spacious and uncluttered environment. The space allows the user to concentrate on the important elements presented. The minimalist approach ensures that the 3D environment is the focal point and it immerses me from the beginning. The responsive animations is so energetic and interactive, they react intuitively to cursor movements and it helps to bring the experience to life. The smooth transitions between sections add fluidity to the experience making it a modern, dynamic feel. The most impressive to me is in my firsts interaction, this combination of design elements already allows the website to set the tone for what users can expect as they navigate more and further.

      <br>
      <p>I spent the most time examining the various areas, including "Omada," "Coach+," and "Spark." Each of these parts is thoughtfully constructed with animated features intended to keep the user interested. The website's design leads users through various parts with interactive prompts and visual clues. Each part represents its own mini-universe filled with distinct clickable components and animations that provide fresh experiences with each interaction. Almost as if they are going through a digital world with something new around every corner. Sub-interactive components, such as mini-games or minor interactive tools, provide an additional layer of engagement.</p>

      <p>The most common action was clicking on various elements to explore around the site. Every click or scroll reveals new content or animations, making it the primary mode of interaction. As I read on  about Luni.app, the website is intended to guide users through exploration by encouraging them to click on various areas to learn more about the Luni ecosystem.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Navigating different sections of the homepage: The layout of the homepage encourages exploration. The site's clear, segmented design naturally leads the user through various sections. They even have some suggestions to help users explore the page further.</li>
              <li>Clicking on literally everything to see how they responded and what new content was revealed: Clicking is the primary means of interaction. Each click reveals new content or animations. The site builds curiosity by rewarding clicks with detailed visual feedback and new information.</li>
              <li>Scrolled minimally: Unlike many websites, that rely heavily on scrolling for navigation. This one pushes viewers to click through various parts. Scrolling is kept to a minimal. I think this website's emphasis on interactive exploration rather than passive consumption.</li>
              <li>Engaged with embedded mini-games or interactive components in each section: The introduction of mini-games and other interactive features enriches the experience.

          <p>
            The site communicates its goal and interaction pattern through clear sections and dynamic animations and it does hint for frequent involvement. The continual feeling of discovery as users explore different areas come along with the possibility of future updates. I believe it suggests that users should return frequently to see what's new. This design choice encourages users to approach the site with curiosity and users have to investigate various sections to discover new material or features that may have been introduced since their previous visit.

              interactive experience?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Personally, I think the interactive experience appears to have two primary goals. First, it seeks to visually engage and immerse visitors in Luni's innovative apps. The website is intended to capture the essence of their work by providing a distinct digital area that represents their brand identity. The use of 3D environments, interactive components, and dynamic animations all help to lure the user into Luni's universe. Second, the site functions as a recruitment tool. It is encouraging people to join the Luni team by immersing them in its culture. The website's goal is to make users feel connected to the brand and ready to interact or join their team.

            <h3>How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3>
            <p>
              This purpose is communicated through the website. Each component is designed to highlight distinct aspects of Luni's offers. It filled with 3D surroundings, seamless navigation, and compelling animations. The site's design does more than just tell the audience about Luni's offerings but also displays them. I think they are trying to potray their brand's identity as a pioneer in immersive online experiences and Luni is committed to developing creative, user-friendly digital solutions that are both functional and eye-catching.

            <h3>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time?</h3>
            <p>
              The experience is maybe captivating enough to keep users
              interested for a short time but I don't think it last for
              long-term interaction. The different sections and interactive
              elements encourage users to revisit and explore further so that
              explains why the overall interaction may be more about the short
              interactions, repeated sessions rather than longer interactions.
              I got a bit bored if I spend more time in here. However, I
              believe it is intended to be reviewed more from time to time to
              introduced users new content and updates and longer interactions
              in the future.

            <h3>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>
            <p>
              I think the experience references the metaverse and similar
              digital environments as well as app-based ecosystems and other
              digital solutions. It is based on concepts familiar from
              interactive applications in which users navigate through a variety
              of interconnected elements. It similar to switching between apps
              on a digital platform. These references bring out
              the interconnected nature of the experience, which, in my point of
              view, aligns with current trends in digital innovation and user
              engagement.

            <h3>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
            <p>
              These references suggest that people approach the experience with curiosity and an exploratory mindset. The site is meant to be explored similar to exploring a metaverse or interacting with numerous apps in a digital ecosystem (such as Apple's). Instead of passively digesting the content, users are urged to click, explore, and discover its interconnection. The site's design invites users to interact with it actively and piecing together the various pieces of what Luni has to offer.          </div>

            <h3>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
            <p>
              The references to the metaverse and app ecosystems are intended to convey a sense of modernity, creativity, and community. Engaging with the experience should make consumers feel like they're part of something innovative and technologically advanced. The site's design is meant to make visitors feel as if they are experiencing the future of digital interaction. This sense is made stronger by the site's emphasis on exploration and discovery and it encourages users to think of themselves as pioneers developing new digital space. The overall impact is one of inclusion and empowerment that having users feeling like they are part of a broader. And also evoke users feelings to be apart of an innovative group that is pushing the limits of what is possible in the digital environment.            </p>

            <h3>What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h3>
            <p>
              The most frustrating part of interacting is the lack of detailed
              information in certain sections. While the website is visually
              appealing and engaging, I feel like it frequently sacrifices depth
              for aesthetics. This can lead to impatience, as users looking for
              more in-depth content or explanations may find themselves constantly
              clicking and searching for information that isn't fully available.
              The balance between form and function, for me, is not good enough.
              Through discovering the website, I feel discouraged and bored for
              seeking more about the website after such a short time.

            <h3>What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h3>
            <p>
              The most satisfying aspect for me is the sleek, user-friendly layout
              and the clear and pleasing presentation of visual information, and
              that is also the reason why I chose this website at the beginning.
              The site's straightforward navigation and the way it encourages
              people to explore make it enjoyable to interact with. The responsive
              animations and the fact that each section of the site feels like a
              mini-experience and space does add a lot to the overall
              satisfaction.
